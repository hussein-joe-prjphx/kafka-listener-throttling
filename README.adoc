# Throttling Batch processing

This example shows how batch processing Kafka listener can throttle to support
batch processing of low priority messages.

## Kafka Listener Pause

In the example we pause a Kafka listener after processing a batch,
this triggers the underlying Kafka consumer to pause and do not poll messages from Kafka until the listener is resumed.

## Realtime and batch listeners

In the example, there are 2 listeners one for batch processing with throttling and the other one for realtime processing.
